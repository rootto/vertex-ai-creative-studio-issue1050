"""Schema-validated shot plans for the profile-driven creative-studio engine.

This module defines the two planner `output_schema`s the engine ships:
  * `AdPlan` — the `ad` profile (Veo clips, duration-budgeted). Default.
  * `StoryboardPlan` — the `storyboard` profile (nanobanana stills, board-paced,
    NO duration budget). See the note above `StoryboardShot` below.

It also defines `QCVerdict` — the `output_schema` of the PR-7 "Editor's QC Room"
critic (both profiles). The critic MEASURES the assembled cut and writes a
`QCVerdict` to `state["qc_verdict"]`; the `LoopAgent` stops on escalate (an
acceptable cut) or the `max_iterations` cap. See `QCVerdict` at the end of this
module and `_build_critic` in agent.py.

`AdPlan` is the planner's `output_schema`. Giving the planner an `output_schema`
turns its reply into a schema-validated JSON spine that lands in session state
(`state["ad_plan"]`) instead of free text — every downstream stage reads a
guaranteed shape rather than parsing prose.

ADK 2.8.0 write path (source-verified against the installed 2.8.0 —
tag v2.8.0 of github.com/google/adk-python):
  - `LlmAgent.output_schema` field: agents/llm_agent.py:404 (docstring :415).
  - On the final response ADK runs `validate_schema(output_schema, text)` and
    stores the result under `output_key`:
    agents/llm_agent.py:1044-1045.
  - For a Pydantic `type[BaseModel]`, `validate_schema` returns a **dict**
    (`schema.model_validate_json(json_text).model_dump(exclude_none=True)`):
    utils/_schema_utils.py:141-142. So `state["ad_plan"]` is a dict, and the
    `{ad_plan}` instruction template renders it via `str(value)`
    (utils/instructions_utils.py:162-165).

MAX_SHOTS is intentionally small and FIXED. ADK's `ParallelAgent` has a STATIC
`sub_agents` list (agents/parallel_agent.py:266 iterates `self.sub_agents`; it
does not fan out to a runtime shot count), so the shot stage builds exactly
MAX_SHOTS sub-agents and each reads `shots[i]` if present / no-ops if absent.
The budget math for MAX_SHOTS is justified in agent.py and the README.

# budgeted: there is deliberately NO veo, NO clip, and — per the design addendum
# §6 ("Duration model: board-paced; narration length drives it, not a hard ad
# budget") — NO hard duration budget. Consequences for this schema:
#   * StoryboardShot carries NO `duration_seconds` (stills, not Veo clips), so
#     the Veo-3 duration grid is irrelevant here.
#   * StoryboardPlan carries NO total-duration field, so the AdPlan aggregate
#     sum-in-[15,120] invariant above DOES NOT APPLY to StoryboardPlan (N/A by
#     design — the animatic length is driven by the narration at assembly time).
