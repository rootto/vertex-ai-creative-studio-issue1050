"""Ad creative-director's assistant — the capstone (run tier).

A brand brief + a target duration (15s-2m) in; one assembled short video ad out.
This is the series' "real multi-agent app": a top-level `SequentialAgent` spine
wrapping a `ParallelAgent` per-shot fan-out, that REUSES the crawl personas you
already shipped (Photoshoot, Director, Music Producer) via `AgentTool` — it does
NOT re-author them.

    SequentialAgent(
        planner,                       # LlmAgent + output_schema=AdPlan -> state["ad_plan"]
        shot_stage = ParallelAgent(    # MAX_SHOTS fixed slots, run concurrently
            shot_1, shot_2, shot_3,    #   each: photoshoot still -> director clip (AgentTool)
        ),
        audio_stage,                   # LlmAgent -> music_producer persona (AgentTool): bed + VO
        assembler,                     # LlmAgent -> avtool: concat + mix + trim-to-video + combine, verify
    )

The engine is built behind `build_root_agent(profile=AD_PROFILE)` (see
profiles.py). It ships TWO profiles: the `ad` capstone (default, above) and the
editorial `storyboard` profile (stills-only, board-paced animatic + package/
manifest) reached through the headless `package` CLI (see package.py). Both use
the SAME graph shape; only the per-stage builders branch on the Profile.
`root_agent = build_root_agent(AD_PROFILE)` so `adk web` shows the ad capstone by
default, unchanged.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADK 2.8.0 constructs used here are source-verified against the installed 2.8.0
(== tag v2.8.0 of github.com/google/adk-python). file:line citations:

  * SequentialAgent  — agents/sequential_agent.py:83 (class); runs its
    sub_agents IN ORDER: `for i in range(start_index, len(self.sub_agents))`
    at :111, sharing one session (state passes via output_key). NOTE it is
    @deprecated in 2.8.0 (:79 "in favor of Workflow") but Workflow "cannot yet
    be used as an LlmAgent sub-agent", so it remains the correct construct and
    is what the merged walk-tier agent already ships.

  * ParallelAgent    — agents/parallel_agent.py:230 (class; @deprecated at :226,
    same caveat as above). Its sub_agents list is STATIC — `_run_async_impl`
    iterates `self.sub_agents` (:266); there is no runtime fan-out to a plan's
    shot count. Sub-agents run CONCURRENTLY via asyncio.TaskGroup
    (`_merge_agent_run` :82, :122) and SHARE session state: each branch ctx is a
    shallow `model_copy()` of the invocation context (:50 in
    `_create_branch_ctx_for_sub_agent` :44) that only changes `branch`, so the
    session (and its `state`) is the same object across branches. -> the fixed
    MAX_SHOTS design below, and each slot reading `shots[i]` if present.

  * AgentTool        — tools/agent_tool.py:109. Wraps an agent so another agent
    can call it as a tool. `run_async` builds its OWN Runner +
    InMemorySessionService (:264) and seeds the child session with a copy of the
    caller's state (:285), so calling the SAME wrapped persona object from
    several concurrent shot slots is isolated (no state clobber).

  * output_schema    — agents/llm_agent.py:404 (field), :415 (docstring). ADK
    validates the final reply against it (`validate_schema` at :1044) and writes
    the result to `state[output_key]` (:1045). For a Pydantic BaseModel the
    stored value is a dict (utils/_schema_utils.py:141-142). The planner has
    NO tools and NO sub_agents — it is a leaf — so the schema enforcement is
    unambiguous; it just emits a validated plan into state.

  * output_key       — agents/llm_agent.py:419 (field); write at :1045.

  * {ad_plan} templating — utils/instructions_utils.py:133 (`_replace_match`)
    reads `session.state["ad_plan"]` (:162) and substitutes `str(value)`; a
    plain (non-`?`) placeholder raises KeyError if absent (:174), which is what
    we want: the planner always runs first, so a missing plan is a real failure.

  * LoopAgent        — agents/loop_agent.py:57 (class; @deprecated :53-56, same
    "in favor of Workflow" caveat as Sequential/Parallel above). Used ONLY when a
    profile sets enable_qc (PR-7): the 4th stage becomes
    LoopAgent(sub_agents=[assembler, critic], max_iterations=profile.qc_max_iterations)
    — the "Editor's QC Room". It stops on EITHER exit, both source-verified:
    (i) the max_iterations HARD CAP — while-condition :95-97
    (`not self.max_iterations or times_looped < self.max_iterations`), times_looped
    incremented :127 — the guarantee against an infinite loop even if the critic
    never escalates; (ii) a sub_agent ESCALATING — it checks `event.actions.escalate`
    on every yielded event (:116-117) and stops. It runs its sub_agents in order
    each pass (:98) and restarts at index 0 each loop (:126), so assembler-FIRST
    means the critic always reviews a real cut. The critic escalates via the local
    `exit_loop` tool (tool_context.actions.escalate = True; ToolContext == Context
    in 2.8.0, `Context.actions` at context.py:290 -> events/event_actions.py:125
    `escalate`). Because an agent can have only ONE parent (base_agent.py:704-712,
    which fires for sub_agents ONLY, not AgentTool), the SINGLE assembler instance
    is placed in EXACTLY ONE tree position — inside the loop when QC is on, else
    the bare 4th sub_agent; never both. The assembler reads the critic's verdict on
    a re-run via the OPTIONAL template `{qc_verdict?}` (instructions_utils.py:136,
    :170-172 renders '' when the key is absent — i.e. on the first pass).

  * FunctionTool     — tools/function_tool.py:99 (class), :106 (__init__ takes a
    `func` and reads its docstring as the tool description). A bare callable in
    an LlmAgent's `tools` list is auto-wrapped in one: llm_agent.py:206-207
    (`if callable(tool_union): return [FunctionTool(func=tool_union)]`). The
    assembler uses this for its one local helper (see AUDIO/VIDEO DURATION below).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUDIO/VIDEO DURATION — why the assembler has a small local ffmpeg helper.
The final ad's audio must not run past the visuals. The reused Music Producer's
Lyria produces a FIXED-length (~30s) music bed — `lyria_generate_music` exposes
no duration/length parameter (mcp-lyria-go/lyria.go:128-161: only `prompt` +
model/output params). And avtool's mixing tools always mix with
`amix=...:duration=longest` and expose NO `-shortest`/`-t`/trim option
(mcp-avtool-go/mcp_handlers.go:485 in ffmpeg_combine_audio_and_video, :1310 in
ffmpeg_layer_audio_files), so a 30s bed over a 20s video yields a ~30s file with
a silent/last-frame tail. Modifying the shared avtool server is out of scope, so
the assembler fills that gap itself with `trim_audio_to_video_length` below (a
FunctionTool that shells the already-required ffmpeg/ffprobe — no new dependency)
and runs it on the mixed audio BEFORE the final combine, so the container tracks
the VIDEO length. This is the one spot the capstone drops below MCP, and it is a
deliberate, documented teaching point (README "How it works").

and target duration into a duration-budgeted shot plan. You emit a STRUCTURED
plan only — you do not call any tools; later stages generate the media from your
plan.

# The duration budget (respect it precisely)
- The finished ad must be between 15 and 120 seconds (15s-2m).
- You have AT MOST {MAX_SHOTS} hero shots. This is a hard cap: the shot stage has
  exactly {MAX_SHOTS} parallel slots, so a {MAX_SHOTS + 1}th shot would be
  silently dropped. Use fewer shots for a short bumper; never exceed {MAX_SHOTS}.
- Each shot becomes a Veo-3 clip, and Veo-3 supports clip durations of ONLY
  4, 6, or 8 seconds. So every shot's `duration_seconds` MUST be 4, 6, or 8.
- Allocate the per-shot durations so their SUM is as close as possible to the
  requested target, up to the hero-footage ceiling of {MAX_SHOTS} x 8 =
  {MAX_SHOTS * 8}s. If the user asks for longer than {MAX_SHOTS * 8}s, plan to
  the {MAX_SHOTS * 8}s ceiling and tell the user this reference capstone caps
  hero footage at {MAX_SHOTS} shots — do NOT invent extra shots to pad the time.

# What each shot needs
For every shot provide: `look` (still art-direction — subject, composition,
lens, light, mood), `motion` (camera/subject motion for the clip), `vo_line`
(one spoken line), and `duration_seconds` (4, 6, or 8). Keep the combined
voiceover concise: all `vo_line`s together should be well under ~800 characters
(the TTS cap the audio stage honors). Also give the ad a `brand`,
`total_duration_seconds`, and a `music_mood` for the score.

   name like `shot-{human:02d}.png` (pass output_directory="./output"). The
   photoshoot persona art-directs, calls nanobanana, and verifies the file by
   existence. Capture the exact local path it reports.

b) `director_videographer` tool — hand it YOUR shot's `motion` plus the still
   from step (a) and ask for an image-to-video (i2v) clip of exactly YOUR shot's
   `duration_seconds` seconds. IMPORTANT constraints to pass through so the clip
   actually renders (the director persona enforces them, but state them):
     - veo_i2v needs the starting image as a gs:// URI, so if your still is
       local, ask the director to use it as the visual reference / first frame;
       if only text motion is available, veo_t2v is acceptable.
     - An explicit Veo-3 model is REQUIRED (the default falls back to a Veo-2
       model that rejects audio and errors). The director defaults to
       veo-3.1-fast-generate-001; keep that unless the plan implies 9:16 (still
       a Veo-3.1 model).
     - duration must be YOUR shot's `duration_seconds` (one of 4/6/8).
   Veo writes to GCS; capture the exact gs:// URI the director verified by
   LISTING the destination (never a bare resource_link).

# 3. Report
End with two labelled lines for shot {human}:
  shot {human} still -> <local path> (verified)
  shot {human} clip  -> <gs:// URI> (verified)

You are the video editor who assembles the final ad. The creative director's
plan is injected below for reference (shot order, total duration):

<ad_plan>
{ad_plan}
</ad_plan>

The shot stage produced one verified clip per shot (in GCS) and the audio stage
produced a verified music bed and a verified VO (local). The exact paths/URIs
are in the conversation above — read them from there; do NOT guess names.

avtool is TRANSFORM-ONLY (it needs real input files and ffmpeg/ffprobe on PATH),
so feed it the concrete paths the earlier stages reported. The output filename
EXTENSION selects the container, so use .mp4 for the video and .m4a/.mp3 for
audio. Assemble in this order:

# 1. Concatenate the clips -> one video
Call `ffmpeg_concatenate_media_files` with `input_media_uris` = the per-shot clip
URIs IN SHOT ORDER, `output_filename="ad_video.mp4"`, and
`output_local_dir="./output"` (or `output_gcs_bucket` if the user wants GCS).

# 2. Mix the music bed + VO -> one audio track
Call `ffmpeg_layer_audio_files` with `input_audio_uris` = [music bed, VO],
`output_filename="ad_mix.m4a"`, `output_local_dir="./output"`. If the VO should
sit above the bed, you may lower the bed with a volume step, but a straight mix
is fine for the reference.

# 3. Trim the mixed audio to the VIDEO length (so the audio doesn't run long)
The Lyria music bed is a fixed ~30s clip and avtool mixes with
`amix=duration=longest`, so the mixed audio from step 2 is usually LONGER than
the video from step 1 — combining them directly would leave the ad's audio
playing over a frozen/black tail. Before combining, call the
`trim_audio_to_video_length` tool with `audio_path` = the mixed audio (step 2),
`video_path` = the concatenated video (step 1), and
`output_path="./output/ad_mix_fit.m4a"`. Use its returned audio path as the
audio input to the next step (it tells you whether it trimmed or no trim was
needed). This keeps BOTH streams and never modifies the video.

# 4. Lay the (fitted) audio over the video -> the final ad
Call `ffmpeg_combine_audio_and_video` with `input_video_uri` = the concatenated
video from step 1, `input_audio_uri` = the fitted audio from step 3,
`output_filename="final_ad.mp4"`, `output_local_dir="./output"`.

# 5. VERIFY the final ad by existence — never a resource_link
Confirm final_ad.mp4 really exists and is within the duration budget: call
`ffmpeg_get_media_info` on it and report its duration, and tell the user to list
the destination (e.g. `ls -l ./output/final_ad.mp4`, or
`gcloud storage ls <gs URI>` for GCS). A tool returning successfully or a bare
resource_link is NOT proof — the destination listing / media info IS. If the
final file cannot be verified, say so plainly; do not claim success.

End with the concrete verified path/URI of the final ad and its measured
duration, and confirm it fits the 15s-2m budget.

def _stills_animatic_instruction(plan_key: str) -> str:

You are the editor who assembles the final editorial ANIMATIC (a stills board set
to narration + music). The planner's storyboard plan is injected for reference,
and the package directory where the final file must land:

<plan>
{{{plan_key}}}
</plan>

Write the final animatic into this directory (an absolute path):
<package_dir>{{package_dir}}</package_dir>

The panel stage produced one verified still per panel (local, named
shot-01.png, shot-02.png, … under {{package_dir}}/shots) and the audio stage
produced a verified music bed ({{package_dir}}/audio/music.mp3) and a verified
narration ({{package_dir}}/audio/narration.wav). The exact paths are in the
conversation above — read them from there; do NOT guess names.

There is NO Veo clip in this profile — you build the video FROM the stills. Work
in this order and verify by existence at the end:

# 1. Build the silent slideshow FROM the stills
Call the `build_stills_animatic_slideshow` tool with `image_paths` = the verified
still paths IN PANEL ORDER, `output_path="{{package_dir}}/slideshow.mp4"`, and
`narration_audio_path="{{package_dir}}/audio/narration.wav"` (so the slideshow is
board-paced to the narration length). Use the video path it reports. If it
returns an ERROR, stop and report it — do not continue.

# 2. Mix the music bed + narration -> one audio track
Call `ffmpeg_layer_audio_files` with `input_audio_uris` =
["{{package_dir}}/audio/music.mp3", "{{package_dir}}/audio/narration.wav"],
`output_filename="animatic_mix.m4a"`, `output_local_dir="{{package_dir}}"`.

# 3. Trim the mixed audio to the SLIDESHOW length
The Lyria bed is a fixed ~30s clip and avtool mixes with amix=duration=longest,
so the mixed audio is usually LONGER than the slideshow — combining directly
leaves audio over a frozen last panel. Call `trim_audio_to_video_length` with
`audio_path` = the mixed audio (step 2), `video_path` = the slideshow (step 1),
and `output_path="{{package_dir}}/animatic_mix_fit.m4a"`. Use its returned audio
path as the audio input to the next step.

# 4. Lay the (fitted) audio over the slideshow -> the animatic
Call `ffmpeg_combine_audio_and_video` with `input_video_uri` = the slideshow from
step 1, `input_audio_uri` = the fitted audio from step 3,
`output_filename="animatic.mp4"`, `output_local_dir="{{package_dir}}"`. The final
file MUST be exactly {{package_dir}}/animatic.mp4 so the packager can find it.

# 5. VERIFY the animatic by existence — never a resource_link
Call `ffmpeg_get_media_info` on {{package_dir}}/animatic.mp4 and report its
duration, and tell the user to list the destination (e.g.
`ls -l {{package_dir}}/animatic.mp4`). A tool returning successfully or a bare
resource_link is NOT proof — the destination listing / media info IS. If the file
cannot be verified, say so plainly; do not claim success.

End with the concrete verified path of {{package_dir}}/animatic.mp4 and its
measured duration.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# QC LOOP support (PR-7). When a profile sets enable_qc, the assembler runs INSIDE
# the editor_qc LoopAgent, ahead of the critic, so its instruction gets this
# preamble prepended. The preamble is GATED behind profile.enable_qc so the
# default (enable_qc=False) assembler instruction stays byte-identical to PR-6.
#
# It deliberately makes the FIRST pass skip the audio fit-trim (step 3) so the
# fixed ~30s Lyria music bed GENUINELY overruns the video — a REAL, measured
# defect for the critic to catch, never a hardcoded "always-fail-once" flag. On a
# failed re-run the assembler applies the trim as the correction notes instruct.
# This makes the Editor's QC Room the place the series' Lyria-overrun trap (the
# whole reason trim_audio_to_video_length exists) is caught AND fixed on-camera.
#
# The ad and storyboard base instructions share the same numbered-step spine
# (1 build/concat, 2 mix, 3 fit-trim, 4 combine, 5 verify), so ONE preamble drives
# both. `{qc_verdict?}` renders '' on the first pass (key absent) and the previous
# verdict dict on a re-run (instructions_utils.py:136, :170-172).
_QC_ASSEMBLER_PREAMBLE = f"""\
# Editor's QC Room — you run INSIDE a review loop
You are assembling this cut inside an "Editor's QC Room" loop: after you finish, a
critic MEASURES the result and either ACCEPTS it (the loop stops) or sends it back
with correction notes for you to fix on the next pass. The previous pass's QC
verdict is injected here — it is EMPTY on your first pass:

<qc_verdict>
{{{QC_STATE_KEY}?}}
</qc_verdict>

HOW TO USE IT (this OVERRIDES the fit-trim guidance in the numbered steps below):
- If <qc_verdict> is EMPTY (this is your FIRST pass): perform the numbered steps
  below but SKIP step 3 (the audio fit-trim) — in step 4 combine the mixed audio
  from step 2 DIRECTLY over the video. Do not pre-emptively trim; the critic needs
  a real cut to measure.
- If <qc_verdict> contains a verdict with "acceptable": false: the previous cut
  FAILED QC. Read its "correction_notes" and "issues" and APPLY the fix — in
  particular DO perform step 3 now (call `trim_audio_to_video_length` on the mixed
  audio against the video), then re-run step 4 (combine) and step 5 (verify) to
  produce a fresh final file. Address EVERY item in the verdict's "issues".

Everything else about the assembly is exactly as described below.

- AUDIO/VIDEO SYNC: the final cut's duration must NOT exceed the video-only
  track's duration by more than {QC_SYNC_TOLERANCE_SECONDS:.1f}s. If the assembler
  skipped the audio fit-trim, the ~30s Lyria music bed overruns the video and the
