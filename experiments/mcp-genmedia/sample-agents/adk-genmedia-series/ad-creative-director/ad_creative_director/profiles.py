"""The profile seam — a plain-Python dataclass + factory input.

The engine is built behind `build_root_agent(profile)` (see agent.py) so the
same graph serves two audiences without reworking it. It ships TWO profiles:
  * `AD_PROFILE` — the ad creative-director capstone (Veo clips, single final
    file). It is the DEFAULT: `root_agent = build_root_agent(AD_PROFILE)`, so
    `adk web` shows the ad capstone unchanged.
  * `STORYBOARD_PROFILE` — the editorial "Creative Studio" storyboard profile
    (nanobanana stills, board-paced animatic, package + manifest). It is reached
    through the headless `package` CLI (see package.py) — the dogfood tool.

DESIGN CONSTRAINT (deliberate): profiles are a **frozen dataclass + factory**,
using only stable ADK constructor APIs. We do NOT use ADK's `from_config` /
`AgentConfig` YAML loader: in ADK 2.8.0 `agents/config_agent_utils.py:from_config`
is decorated BOTH `@deprecated` AND `@experimental(FeatureName.AGENT_CONFIG)`, so
building the engine on it would schedule a removal into the series.

class Profile:
    """Selects what the one engine produces for a given audience.

    Attributes:
      name: short profile id, used in the root agent's name ("ad" |
        "storyboard").
      planner_persona: tone/audience prose appended to the profile's planner
        instruction base (see agent.py).
      plan_schema: the planner's `output_schema` (AdPlan | StoryboardPlan).
      shot_media: what each per-shot slot produces —
        "clips": photoshoot still -> Veo clip (director); the ad path.
        "stills": photoshoot still ONLY (no director, no Veo); the storyboard
        path (addendum §6: cheaper/faster/deterministic docs tool).
      assembler_recipe: which assembly the assembler runs —
        "video_ad_concat": concat clips + mix music/VO + trim + combine (ad).
        "stills_animatic": stills -> silent slideshow + mix music/narration +
        trim + combine into animatic.mp4 (storyboard).
      emit_package: False (ad: single final file) | True (storyboard: a package
        directory + a machine-readable manifest.json, produced by the headless
        `package` CLI's deterministic packager — see package.py).
      plan_state_key: the session-state key the planner writes its schema-
        validated plan to and every downstream stage reads via `{key}`
        templating. "ad_plan" for the ad profile (unchanged from PR-5), "plan"
        for the storyboard profile (the key the addendum §4.2d/§4.4 packager
        reads).
      enable_qc: when True, the 4th (assembler) stage is wrapped in a `LoopAgent`
        — the "Editor's QC Room" (PR-7). The assembler runs FIRST each iteration
        (builds/rebuilds the cut) and a critic runs SECOND: it MEASURES the cut
        (ffprobe) and either escalates to stop the loop (cut acceptable) or writes
        correction notes the assembler reads on the next iteration. False (the
        default) preserves the pre-PR-7 behavior exactly — a bare assembler as the
        4th stage, no loop. Both shipped profiles set it True.
      qc_max_iterations: the LoopAgent's hard `max_iterations` cap — the guarantee
        against an infinite loop even if the critic never escalates
        (google-adk loop_agent.py:95-97). Small on purpose (2): one pass to build
        + catch, one to fix + accept. Only consulted when enable_qc is True.
